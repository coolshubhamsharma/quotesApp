## About Us 

 The Quotes Management App is a platform that allows users to browse, add, and view quotes from various authors. Built with the MERN stack, it offers a seamless and responsive experience for discovering and sharing inspirational quotes. Our goal is to create a space where users can find motivation and share words of wisdom effortlessly.

## Problem Statement
The Quotes Management App is developed as a hands-on project to explore and practice the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). While serving as a functional platform for browsing, adding, and viewing quotes, the primary goal of this project was educational. It provided an opportunity to gain practical experience in full-stack development, RESTful API design, frontend interactions, and database management, enabling developers to deepen their understanding of modern web technologies through real-world application.
